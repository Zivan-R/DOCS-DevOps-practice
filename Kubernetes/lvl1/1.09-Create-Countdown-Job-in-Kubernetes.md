# 1.09 Create Countdown Job in Kubernetes

## Task
The Nautilus DevOps team is crafting jobs in the Kubernetes cluster. While they're developing actual scripts/commands, they're currently setting up templates and testing jobs with dummy commands. Please create a job template as per details given below:

1. Create a job named countdown-datacenter.
2. The spec template should be named countdown-datacenter (under metadata), and the container should be named container-countdown-datacenter
3. Utilize image fedora with latest tag (ensure to specify as fedora:latest), and set the restart policy to Never.
4. Execute the command sleep 5

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is set up to operate with the Kubernetes cluster.
