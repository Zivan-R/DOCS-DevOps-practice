# 1.06 Revert Deployment to Previous Version in Kubernetes

## Task
Earlier today, the Nautilus DevOps team deployed a new release for an application. However, a customer has reported a bug related to this recent release. Consequently, the team aims to revert to the previous version.

There exists a deployment named nginx-deployment; initiate a rollback to the previous revision.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is configured to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.

  ## Solution
  1. Check the rollout history
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment
  # Note the change of the current revision
  # (Here image was changed to nginx:alpine)
  ```
  2. Undo previous rollout
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment
  ```
  3. Check history again, to confirm it worked
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment
  # Should be on another Revision now
  ```
  4. Verify image
  ```bash
  kubectl get deployment nginx-deployment \
  -o=jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}{"\n"}'

  # Image should have reverted to previous deployment
  # (Here nginx:1.16 instead of alpine)
  ```
