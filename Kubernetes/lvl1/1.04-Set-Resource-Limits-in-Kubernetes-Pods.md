# 1.04 Set Resource Limits in Kubernetes Pods

## Task
The Nautilus DevOps team has noticed performance issues in some Kubernetes-hosted applications due to resource constraints. To address this, they plan to set limits on resource utilization. Here are the details:

Create a pod named httpd-pod with a container named httpd-container. Use the httpd image with the latest tag (specify as httpd:latest). Set the following resource limits:

Requests: Memory: 15Mi, CPU: 100m

Limits: Memory: 20Mi, CPU: 100m

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is configured to operate with the Kubernetes cluster.

  ## Solution
  1. Generate the skeleton YAML manifest for the pod
  ```bash
  kubectl run httpd-pod \
  --image=httpd:latest \
  --restart=Never \
  --dry-run=client \
  -o yaml > httpd-pod.yaml
  ```
  2. Edit the YAML
  ```yaml
  # Change container name and add resources requests and limits
  # Result should be like this:
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    creationTimestamp: null
    labels:
      run: httpd-pod
    name: httpd-pod
  spec:
    containers:
    - image: httpd:latest
      name: httpd-container
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "100m"
          memory: "15Mi"
        limits:
          cpu: "100m"
          memory: "20Mi"
    dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
    restartPolicy: Never
  status: {}
  ```
  3. Apply
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f httpd-pod.yaml
  ```
  4. Verify
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  kubectl describe pod httpd-pod
  ```
