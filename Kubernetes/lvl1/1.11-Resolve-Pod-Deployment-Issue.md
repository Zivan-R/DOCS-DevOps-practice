A junior DevOps team member encountered difficulties deploying a stack on the Kubernetes cluster. The pod fails to start, presenting errors. Let's troubleshoot and rectify the issue promptly.

1. There is a pod named webserver, and the container within it is named nginx-container, its utilizing the nginx:latest image.
2. Additionally, there's a sidecar container named sidecar-container using the ubuntu:latest image.

  ## Solution
  1. Inspect the Pod status and logs
  ```bash
  kubectl describe pod webserver
  kubectl logs webserver -c sidecar-container

  # In this case, we notice Error: ErrImagePull / Back-off pulling image "nginx:latests"
  # The problem is a typo in the image tag
  ```
  3. Edit the pod to fix the image tag
  ```bash
  kubectl edit pod webserver

  # Find the image field and change it to nginx:latest
  ```
  4. Verify
  ```bash
  kubectl get pod webserver
  # Should be running now

  kubectl logs webserver -c sidecar-container
  # Now the sidecar works too
  ```
