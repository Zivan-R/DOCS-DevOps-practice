# 1.12 Update Deployment and Service in Kubernetes

## Task
An application deployed on the Kubernetes cluster requires an update with new features developed by the Nautilus application development team. The existing setup includes a deployment named nginx-deployment and a service named nginx-service. Below are the necessary changes to be implemented without deleting the deployment and service:

1. Modify the service nodeport from 30008 to 32165
2. Change the replicas count from 1 to 5
3. Update the image from nginx:1.19 to nginx:latest

  # Verify the change
  kubectl get svc nginx-service -o wide
  ```
  2. Scale the deployment to 5 replicas
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment nginx-deployment --replicas=5
  ```
  3. Update the Deployment's image
  ```bash
  kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment '*=nginx:latest'
  ```
  4. Verify
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment

  kubectl get deployment nginx-deployment \
  -o=jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}{"\n"}'
  ```
