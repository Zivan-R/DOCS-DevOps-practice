# 1.07 Deploy ReplicaSet in Kubernetes Cluster

## Task
The Nautilus DevOps team is gearing up to deploy applications on a Kubernetes cluster for migration purposes. A team member has been tasked with creating a ReplicaSet outlined below:

1. Create a ReplicaSet using httpd image with latest tag (ensure to specify as httpd:latest) and name it httpd-replicaset.
2. Apply labels: app as httpd_app, type as front-end.
3. Name the container httpd-container. Ensure the replica count is 4.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is set up to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.

  ## Solution
  1. Generate skeleton YAML
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment httpd-replicaset \
  --image=httpd:latest \
  --replicas=4 \
  --dry-run=client \
  -o yaml > httpd-replicaset.yaml

  # We create a deployment and not a ReplicaSet dry-run simply because we can't
  # Do it directly. This is a workaround to avoid writing the whole YAML
  ```
  2. Edit YAML
  ```yaml
  # Expected final YAML
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: ReplicaSet
  metadata:
    labels:
      app: httpd_app
      type: front-end
    name: httpd-replicaset
  spec:
    replicas: 4
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: httpd_app
        type: front-end
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: httpd_app
          type: front-end
      spec:
        containers:
        - image: httpd:latest
          name: httpd-container
          resources: {}
  status: {}

  # /!\ MAKE SURE TO REMOVE STRATEGY, it's not supported
  ```
  3. Apply
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f httpd-replicaset.yaml
  ```
  4. Verify
  ```bash
  kubectl get rs httpd-replicaset
  kubectl describe rs httpd-replicaset
  ```
