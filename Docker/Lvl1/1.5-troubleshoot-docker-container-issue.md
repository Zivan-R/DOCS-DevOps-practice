# 1.5 Troubleshoot Docker Container Issue
---
## Task
An issue has arisen with a static website running in a container named nautilus on App Server 1. To resolve the issue, investigate the following details:

1. Check if the container's volume /usr/local/apache2/htdocs is correctly mapped with the host's volume /var/www/html.
2. Verify that the website is accessible on host port 8080 on App Server 1. Confirm that the command curl http://localhost:8080/ works on App Server 1.

## Solution7
1. SSH into App Server 1
2. Check the volume mapping
```bash
docker inspect nautilus --format '{{ range .Mounts }}{{ .Source }} -> {{ .Destination }}{{ println }}{{ end }}'
# Expected output: /var/www/html -> /usr/local/apache2/htdocs
```
3. Verify container status
```bash
docker ps -a | grep nautilus
# Note exit code
```
4. Check container logs
```bash
docker logs nautilus
```
Logs should show a clean startup and graceful shutdown (SIGWINCH). We know the mount is correct, so maybe the issue is how the container was started
5. Try starting container with -d
```bash
docker rm nautilus
docker run --name nautilus -d -p 8080:80 -v /var/www/html:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs httpd
```
6. Test website accessibility
```bash
docker ps
curl http://localhost:8080
```
Now the container works, the issue was that -d (for detached) was missing.

### Summary:
The Apache container nautilus was exiting immediately after startup on App Server 1, causing the static website to be inaccessible on localhost:8080

The content directory /var/www/html on the host existed and was properly populated, but the container itself was originally started without the -d (detached) flag.  
This caused the container to shutdown gracefully after launch as seen in the logs.

Solution: Container was re-created and started properly  
Optionally: Add --restart unless-stopped for resilience
