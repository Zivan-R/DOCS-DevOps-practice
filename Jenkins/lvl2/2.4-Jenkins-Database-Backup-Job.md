# 2.4 Jenkins Database Backup Job
---
## Task
There is a requirement to create a Jenkins job to automate the database backup. Below you can find more details to accomplish this task:

Click on the Jenkins button on the top bar to access the Jenkins UI. Login using username admin and password Adm!n321.

1. Create a Jenkins job named database-backup.
2. Configure it to take a database dump of the kodekloud_db01 database present on the Database server in Stratos Datacenter, the database user is kodekloud_roy and password is asdfgdsd.
3. The dump should be named in db_$(date +%F).sql format, where date +%F is the current date.
4. Copy the db_$(date +%F).sql dump to the Backup Server under location /home/clint/db_backups.
5. Further, schedule this job to run periodically at */10 * * * * (please use this exact schedule format).

  ## Solution
  1. Manage Jenkins > Plugins > Install Publish over SSH & Credentials binding plugins
  2. Manage Jenkins > Credentials > System > Global credentials (unrestricted)
  3. Add credentials for Backup server, Database and Database server
  ```
  Kind: Username with password
  Username: clint
  Password: <look up password in resources>
  ID: backup-clint
  ```
  ```
  Kind: Username with password
  Username: kodekloud_roy
  Password: asdfgdsd
  ID: db-roy
  ```
  ```
  Kind: Username with password
  Username: peter
  Password: <look up password in resources>
  ID: db-peter
  ```
  4. Manage Jenkins > System > Configure backup server for Publish over SSH
  5. From Dashboard, make database-backup job as a freestyle project
  6. In the job's config, Build triggers > build periodically > */10 * * * *
  7. Environment > Use secret texts or files: bind credentials to environment
  8. Add build step: dump database (Execute shell)
  ```bash
  # filename with current date
  FILENAME=db_$(date +%F).sql
  
  # run mysqldump on remote DB server over SSH, pipe output into workspace file
  sshpass -p "$DB_SSH_PASS" ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no \
    "$DB_SSH_USER"@database.stratos.xfusioncorp.com \
    "mysqldump -u $DB_USER -p\"$DB_PASS\" kodekloud_db01" \
    > "$WORKSPACE/$FILENAME"
  ```
  9. Add post-build action: transfer dump to backup server (send build artifacts over ssh)
  ```
  Source files: db_*.sql
  Remote directory: /home/clint/db_backups
  ```
  10. Save and build it once to see if everything works
