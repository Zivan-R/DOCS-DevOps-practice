# 1.4 Update Git Repository with Sample HTML File
---
## Task
The Nautilus development team has initiated a new project development, establishing various Git repositories to manage each project's source code. Recently, a repository named /opt/cluster.git was created. The team has provided a sample index.html file located on the jump host under the /tmp directory. This repository has been cloned to /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on the storage server in the Stratos DC.

1. Copy the sample index.html file from the jump host to the storage server placing it within the cloned repository at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster.
2. Add and commit the file to the repository.
3. Push the changes to the master branch.
## Solution
1. Copy index.html to a directory on storage server (user must have access)
```bash
scp index.html user@ststor01:/home/user
```
2. SSH into storage server
```bash
ssh user@ststor01
```
3. Move index.html to /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster/
```bash
sudo mv index.html /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster/
```
4. CD into /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster/
```bash
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster/
```
5. Verify the remote repo configuration
```bash
sudo git remote

# Expected: origin
```
6. Add, commit and push the changes
```bash
sudo git add index.html
sudo git commit -m "added index.html"
sudo git push origin master
```
