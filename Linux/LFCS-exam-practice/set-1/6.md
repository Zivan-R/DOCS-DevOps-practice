## Task
You have an xfs filesystem on /dev/vdb1. Also, there's an ext4 filesystem on /dev/vdb2.  
1. Edit the correct file in /etc/ so that /dev/vdb1 is automatically mounted into the /backups directory every time the system boots up. Default mount options should be used.
2. /dev/vdb2 is already mounted in /mnt/. But there is a problem. Sensitive data exists on this ext4 filesystem and you want to make sure that it's not accidentally modified. To solve this problem, remount /dev/vdb2 into the /mnt directory, but this time, with the read-only mount option. It does not matter what the other mount options are. Just make sure this mount point is read-only so that users cannot change contents on this filesystem.
