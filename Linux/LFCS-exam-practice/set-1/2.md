## Task
Perform the following two tasks:
1. Create a bash script that recursively copies the /var/www/ directory into the /opt/www-backup/ directory.
   Save your script at /opt/script.sh. Remember, the script file you create also has to be executable.

2. Make sure that your script /opt/script.sh automatically runs every day at 4AM. More specifically, create a cron job that runs that script every day at 4AM. Put this in the system-wide cron table (not root's local cron table) and make sure the script executes under the root user.

## Solution
1. Create script
```bash
sudo vim /opt/script.sh
```
```bash
#!/bin/bash

mkdir -p /opt/www-backup
cp -a /var/www/* /opt/www-backup/
# -a preserves attributes

echo "Backup of /var/www/ completed successfuly"
```
```bash
sudo chmod +x /opt/script.sh
```
2. Run and verify script
```bash
ls -l /var/www
sudo /opt/script.sh
ls -l /opt/www-backup
```
3. Make cron job (run auto at 4AM daily as root -> system-wide crontab)
```bash
sudo vim /etc/crontab
```
```bash
0 4 * * * root /opt/script.sh
```
4. Restart cron service
```bash
sudo systemctl restart cron
```
