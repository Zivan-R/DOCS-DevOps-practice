## Task
Perform the following two tasks:
1. Create a bash script that recursively copies the /var/www/ directory into the /opt/www-backup/ directory.
   Save your script at /opt/script.sh. Remember, the script file you create also has to be executable.

2. Make sure that your script /opt/script.sh automatically runs every day at 4AM. More specifically, create a cron job that runs that script every day at 4AM. Put this in the system-wide cron table (not root's local cron table) and make sure the script executes under the root user.
