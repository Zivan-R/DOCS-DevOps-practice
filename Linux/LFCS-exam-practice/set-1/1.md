## Task
In the /opt/findme/ directory you will find 10,000 files.  
You need to filter out specific files

1. Find all files that have the executable permission bit enabled for the user that owns them. Redirect the output of the find command to the /opt/foundthem.txt file
2. Find all files that have the SETUID permission enabled and delete them
3. Find any file that is larger than 1KB and copy it to the /opt/ directory

## Solution
1. Find Files with User Executable Permission
```bash
sudo find /opt/findme -type f -perm -u=x | sudo tee /opt/foundthem.txt > /dev/null

# Note: Simple redirection won't work because > /opt/foundthem.txt is processed
# By the shell, which is running with current user's permissions, hence usage of sudo tee
```
2. Find Files with SETUID and Delete Them
```bash
sudo find /opt/findme -type f -perm -4000 -exec rm {} \;
```
3. Find Files Larger Than 1KB and Copy Them to /opt/
```bash
sudo find /opt/findme -type f -size +1k -exec cp {} /opt/ \;
```
