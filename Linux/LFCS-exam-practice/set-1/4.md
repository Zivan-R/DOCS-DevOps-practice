## Task
Create a new user on this system called mary
1. Set her password to 1234.
2. Leave the full name and other personal details empty.
3. Set her default shell to /bin/dash.
4. Make sure she can execute sudo commands by adding her to the secondary group called sudo.
5. At this point Mary's primary group is mary. And her secondary group is sudo. Change her primary group to developers. Without affecting her secondary group.

## Solution
1. Create user and set password when prompted
```bash
sudo adduser mary --gecos "" --shell /bin/dash
# GECOS field is full name and other personal details. Here it's set to empty string
```
2. Add user to sudo group
```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo mary
```
3. Create "developers" group if it doesn't exist
```bash
sudo groupadd developers
```
4. Change user's primary group
```bash
sudo usermod -g developers mary
```
5. Check user's group membership and default shell
```bash
id mary
grep "^mary:" /etc/passwd
```
