## Task
Modify the following kernel runtime parameter:  
- vm.swappiness set it to a value of 10. This should be a persistent change, added to a file so that vm.swappiness is set to 10 every time the system boots up. However, after you create the proper file, also set this runtime parameter to 10 for this session as well. Otherwise said, the file will set the parameter to 10 the next time the system boots up, but we want to set it to 10 even for this current, active session, instead of waiting until the next boot until that takes effect.  
## Solution
