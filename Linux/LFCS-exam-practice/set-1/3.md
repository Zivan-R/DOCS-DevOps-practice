Enforce some limits on two users:  
1. Set a limit on the user called john so that he can open no more than 30 processes. This should be a hard limit.
2. For the user called jane make sure she can create files not larger than 1024 kilobytes. Make this a soft limit.

```bash
john  hard  nproc  30
jane  soft  fsize  1024
```
