# 1.14 Default GUI Boot Configuration
---
## Task
With the installation of new tools on the app servers within the Stratos Datacenter, certain functionalities now necessitate graphical user interface (GUI) access.

Adjust the default runlevel on all App servers in Stratos Datacenter to enable GUI booting by default. It's imperative not to initiate a server reboot after completing this task.  
## Solution
### For each app server:
Update the symlink:
```bash
sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target
```
Expected output:
```
Removed "/etc/systemd/system/default.target".
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/default.target â†’ /usr/lib/systemd/system/graphical.target.
```
