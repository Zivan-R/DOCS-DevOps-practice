# 1.17 Process Limit Adjustment
---
## Task
In the Stratos Datacenter, our Storage server is encountering performance degradation due to excessive processes held by the nfsuser user. To mitigate this issue, we need to enforce limitations on its maximum processes. Please set the maximum process limits as specified below:  

a. Set the soft limit to 1025  
b. Set the hard limit to 2024

## Solution
1. SSH into storage server
2. Add to /etc/security/limits.conf
```bash
sudo vi /etc/security/limits.conf

# Append at the end:
nfsuser soft nproc 1025
nfsuser hard nproc 2024
```
3. Log out all nfsuser shells to enforce new limits immediately
```bash
sudo killall -u nfsuser
```
