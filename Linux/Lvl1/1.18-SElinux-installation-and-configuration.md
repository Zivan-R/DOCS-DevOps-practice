# 1.18 SElinux Installation and Configuration
---
## Task
Following a security audit, the xFusionCorp Industries security team has opted to enhance application and server security with SELinux. To initiate testing, the following requirements have been established for App server 3 in the Stratos Datacenter:
  
1. Install the required SELinux packages.  
2. Permanently disable SELinux for the time being; it will be re-enabled after necessary configuration changes.  
3. No need to reboot the server, as a scheduled maintenance reboot is already planned for tonight.  
4. Disregard the current status of SELinux via the command line; the final status after the reboot should be disabled.

## Solution
1. SSH into app server 3
2. Install SELinux packages
```bash
sudo dnf install -y policycoreutils policycoreutils-python-utils selinux-policy-targeted
```
3. Verify package installation
```bash
rpm -q policycoreutils policycoreutils-python-utils selinux-policy-targeted

# Expected output: The three packages names with their versions
```
4. Edit /etc/selinux/config
```bash
vi /etc/selinux/config

# Set these:
SELINUX=disabled
SELINUXTYPE=targeted
```
5. Verify /etc/selinux/config
```bash
grep -E '^SELINUX=' /etc/selinux/config
grep -E '^SELINUXTYPE=' /etc/selinux/config

# Expected output:
SELINUX=disabled
SELINUXTYPE=targeted
```
