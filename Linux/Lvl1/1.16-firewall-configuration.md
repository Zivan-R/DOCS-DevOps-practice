# 1.16 Firewall Configuration
---
## Task
The Nautilus system admins team has rolled out a web UI application for their backup utility on the Nautilus backup server within the Stratos Datacenter. This application operates on port 8082, and firewalld is active on the server. To meet operational needs, the following requirements have been identified:  
Allow all incoming connections on port 8082/tcp. Ensure the zone is set to public.
## Solution
1. SSH into backup server
2. Ensure firewalld is running
```bash
systemctl status firewalld
```
3. Open port 8082/tcp at runtime
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8082/tcp
```
4. Persist rule across reboots
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8082/tcp --permanent
```
5. Reload firewalld to apply permanent rule to the runtime
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```
6. Verify
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-ports
```
