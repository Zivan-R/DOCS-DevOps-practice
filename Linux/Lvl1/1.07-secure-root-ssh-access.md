## Solution
For each app server:  
  
1. SSH into the server
2. Back Up the original configuration
```bash
sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.bak
```
3. Edit the SSH Daemon configuration file
```bash
# Set PermitRootLogin to no or add it if it isn't present in the file
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Alternative: Edit in the CLI with sed
sudo sed -i 's/^PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
4. Verify SSH configuration
```bash
# Edit the file if necessary to fix any syntax error
sudo sshd -t
```
5. Restart SSH Service
```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```
