# Welcome to my personal practice documentation collection
Here you will find various documentations about my personal hands-on practice on various DevOps, Cloud and Sys admin tasks.

## Why ?
The main reason is, I find it tedious to search the whole Internet every time I need to do something but I forgot how to.  
I firmly believe lots of hands on practice is crucial in order to build real world skills applicable in a professional environment. But since there is so much to learn, and I can't remember everything perfectly, I wanted something to refer to.  
Oh and I discovered the more I do it, the more I enjoy writing documentations! It helps me understand deeper, remember better and above all, it's satisfying to write!
